#Loops in Python
#Loops have the two types in the Python programming language.
#1. For loop
#2. While loop
#For loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.
#While loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.
#For loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.

#While loop
#While loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.

#while condition
  #body

#Practice 1: While loop
a = 10
while a >= 0:
    a -= 1
    print("a")

#Practice 2: While loop with condition
count = 4
while count <= 5:
   print(count)
   count += 1    
 
#Variable is called iterators. 
#And run the loop is called the iteration.


#Some are the examples of loops in Python
#Example 1: Basic for loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num * 2)

#Example 2: While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is {count}")
    count += 1

#Example 3: For loop with range
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
